# 👋 Hi, I’m Shanette

I’m currently studying **BSc Information & Cyber Security** at Teesside University London. I’m still at the early stages of my journey, but I’m really interested in **cyber security and digital forensics** and I’m excited to build my skills as I go.

Right now I’m learning the basics of:
- Python  
- SQL  
- Cyber security principles  
- GDPR and keeping information safe  
- System design and how secure systems are built  

Alongside my degree, I work as a **Temporary Accommodation Officer (Complaints)**. I deal with sensitive information every day, investigate cases, write reports, and follow GDPR rules. This has helped me understand the importance of data protection, accuracy, and secure systems — which is why cyber security interests me.
